1. Develop a comprehensive framework for modeling climate-financial risk transmission
2. Quantify the impact of climate stress on financial market regimes
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of climate policies in reducing financial risk
4. Provide an open-source, reproducible analysis using only free data sources

- Integration of regime-switching and jump-diffusion models with climate extensions
- Novel climate-dependent parameters in both transition probabilities and jump intensities
- Comprehensive policy scenario analysis framework

**Empirical Contributions**:
- Evidence of climate-financial transmission using 9+ years of data

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Climate-Financial Risk Literature

The literature on climate-financial risk has evolved rapidly, with key contributions from:

**Battiston et al. (2017)** introduced climate stress testing for financial systems, demonstrating how climate risks can propagate through interconnected financial networks.

**Bolton & Kacperczyk (2021)** provided empirical evidence that investors price carbon risk, with carbon-intensive firms trading at higher risk premiums.

**Giglio et al. (2021)** documented the relationship between climate risks and asset prices, showing that climate concerns significantly affect real estate valuations.

### 2.2 Regime-Switching Models

**Hamilton (1989)** introduced the foundational Markov regime-switching model, allowing for different market states with distinct statistical properties.

**Kim & Nelson (1999)** extended the framework to multivariate settings, enabling analysis of multiple financial variables simultaneously.

**Guidolin (2011)** provided comprehensive coverage of regime-switching applications in empirical finance.

### 2.3 Jump-Diffusion Models

**Merton (1976)** developed the jump-diffusion model for option pricing, incorporating discontinuous price movements.

**Kou (2002)** extended jump-diffusion models with double exponential jump distributions, improving empirical fit.

**Duffie et al. (2000)** introduced affine jump-diffusion models, enabling analytical solutions for many derivatives.
